## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd whatwethinking
```

2. Install all dependencies:
```bash
npm run install-all
```

### Development

To run both frontend and backend in development mode:
```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start:
- Backend server on `http://localhost:3001`
- Frontend development server on `http://localhost:3000`

### Individual Commands

**Backend only:**
```bash
npm run server
```

**Frontend only:**
```bash
npm run client
```

### Production

1. Build the frontend:
```bash
npm run build
```

2. Start the production server:
```bash
npm start
```

The server will serve both the API and the built React app.
